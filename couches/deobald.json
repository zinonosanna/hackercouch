{"city":"Bangalore","country":"IN","region":"Cooke Town","email":"steven@nilenso.com","github":"deobald","couchsurfing":null,"relative_path":"_json/deobald.md","url":"/couches/deobald.json","content":"<p>I sleep on a small mat in the living room, so my bed is always available to visitors. It’s a king-sized mattress and can comfortably accomodate two people. My flat has one bathroom, a balcony, a large refrigerator, a gas stove, a desk, a table, and plenty of tea. Oh. And wifi.</p>\n\n<p>I practice Zero Waste. This means all garbage in my house falls into two categories:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Clean/washed recyclable dry waste (e-waste, paper, plastic, metal, glass).</li>\n  <li>Compost.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>…for this reason, I do not cook or eat meat at home and I do not have food delivered. Guests will need to follow these simple rules: no meat in the house and no mixed (non-recyclable) waste. The latter means no delivery and no take-out. Hopefully no one will find these restrictions too inconvenient.</p>\n\n<p>Local amenities include a supermarket, drycleaner, tailor, a few restaurants, and a couple coffee shops / cafes. Cooke Town is primarily residential which means it’s quiet… but not that convenient. :)</p>\n"}
